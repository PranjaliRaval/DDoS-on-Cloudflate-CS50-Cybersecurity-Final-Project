# DDoS on Cloudflare - CS50 Cybersecurity Final Project

## Introduction
In October 2024, Cloudflare, a global leader in web performance and security, faced the largest-ever Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. This attack reached a record-breaking peak of 38 terabits-per-second (Tbps), targeting financial and enterprise systems with the aim of causing widespread disruption. The scale of this incident set a new benchmark in volumetric cyberattacks, emphasizing the critical importance of robust cybersecurity measures.

The attack was a striking demonstration of how DDoS threats are evolving in sophistication and size, making even highly resilient systems vulnerable to temporary failures. It also highlighted how modern cyberattacks are no longer just technical challenges but also financial and reputational threats for businesses worldwide. Cloudflare's successful mitigation of this attack showcased the importance of advanced defense strategies.

This project delves into the technical and strategic aspects of this record-breaking attack, providing an insightful look into modern DDoS techniques and their mitigation. It serves as a reminder of the continuous innovation needed in cybersecurity to counter ever-growing threats.

## What is DDoS?
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of malicious cyberattack where an unauthorized adversary attempts to disrupt the normal functioning of a server, network, or service. The attack works by overwhelming the target with a flood of internet traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. A DDoS attack often uses a botnet—a network of compromised devices—to generate this massive traffic.

DDoS attacks can target different layers of a network, such as the application layer (Layer 7) or the network layer (Layer 3/4). The goal is to exploit system vulnerabilities, exhaust server resources, and ultimately deny service to users. These attacks are increasingly complex, with attackers leveraging techniques such as amplification and protocol spoofing to intensify their impact.

The Cloudflare incident discussed in this project involved a multi-vector DDoS attack that utilized advanced methods to bypass traditional mitigation systems. This attack serves as a case study to understand the growing challenges in defending against DDoS threats.

## Attack Discussed
- **Volume and Complexity:** The attack generated 38 Tbps of traffic, the largest ever recorded. Its sheer scale was designed to overwhelm even the most advanced defense systems, demonstrating the growing potential of volumetric attacks.

- **Techniques Used:**
  - **HTTP Floods:** Flooded the target with large numbers of HTTP requests mimicking legitimate user behavior.
  - **Protocol Spoofing:** Simulated traffic from browsers like Google Chrome to bypass detection systems.
  - **UDP Amplification:** Exploited protocols like DNS and SSDP to amplify small requests into massive responses, increasing attack volume.

- **Botnet Deployment:** The attack relied heavily on a botnet comprising millions of compromised IoT devices and servers. These devices, often insecurely configured, played a key role in generating the malicious traffic.

## Relevance to the Course
This project is closely aligned with the core principles of the **CS50 Cybersecurity course**, as it examines a real-world application of cybersecurity concepts. Understanding DDoS attacks is crucial for cybersecurity professionals, as these attacks are among the most prevalent and disruptive in the digital landscape.

The project explores how a record-breaking DDoS attack was launched, the technical methodologies employed, and the countermeasures used to mitigate the threat. These insights directly tie to the course's focus on identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing attack strategies, and developing robust defense mechanisms. It provides practical knowledge that reinforces the theoretical concepts covered in the course, including network security, traffic analysis, and mitigation techniques.

Through this project, students can gain a deeper appreciation for the challenges faced by organizations in combating modern cyber threats and the innovative solutions required to address them.

## Features
1. **Detailed Technical Analysis:**  
   The project provides an in-depth analysis of the techniques and scale of the attack. It explains how advanced methods like HTTP floods and UDP amplification were employed to achieve record-breaking traffic volumes.

2. **Insights into Mitigation Strategies:**  
   It highlights Cloudflare's innovative response, such as using a global Anycast network to distribute and absorb attack traffic across 300+ cities. This ensured the attack was neutralized without affecting legitimate users.

3. **Focus on IoT Security:**  
   The attack revealed the vulnerability of IoT devices, which were easily exploited to form a botnet. The project emphasizes the urgent need for stronger IoT security measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

4. **Understanding Multi-Vector Attacks:**  
   The project discusses how attackers are combining multiple techniques to target different layers of the network, making detection and mitigation more challenging for traditional systems.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes from the growing frequency and severity of DDoS attacks worldwide. This particular attack on Cloudflare not only demonstrated the scale of modern cyber threats but also showcased the importance of innovative defense mechanisms. By studying this incident, the project aims to raise awareness about the significance of cybersecurity in protecting digital infrastructure.

Understanding DDoS attacks is crucial for aspiring cybersecurity professionals, as these attacks are among the most common and impactful cyber threats today. The project hopes to inspire further research and development in the field of cybersecurity to counter such sophisticated threats.
